## K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier for a Binary Classification Problem.ipynb

This Jupyter Notebook gives a K-NN classifier for a binary classification problem, as well as functions to evaluate the accuracy of said classifier. An example problem is included to demonstrate the classifier's high accuracy in classifying banknotes as either counterfeit or legitimate.

## banknote.csv

This table is used in the example problem.
